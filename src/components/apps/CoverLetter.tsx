        <p className="text-gray-200">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-200">
          I have never known exactly what to write in a cover letter.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Should I tell y'all about how I am a hard worker. Well I believe I am... but so are a lot of people.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Or maybe you want to know I am a problem solver? But, doesn't a degree in computer engineering already mean that.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          I think the best way to introduce myself is simply... I love to learn. I have determined that I will have to learn my whole life, but my 20s and 30s will be entirely dedicated to learning.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Learning didn't come easily to me.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          I struggled when I entered college because I didn't know how to study. I tried reading textbooks cover to cover... I tried listening to professors drone on about their research... I tried going to office hours and annoying the Teaching Assistants...
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          It took me years to get my system to about 90% efficacy.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Now I learn everywhere I can. I subscribe to newsletters so my inbox is filled with whatever I am trying to grasp at any period of time. I buy the top 20 books in whichever field I want to digest. I cold call or cold dm hundreds of experts to meet them and pick their brains. I build systems around myself to make learning as easy and enjoyable as possible. From cleaning my YouTube subscriptions to only be about that topic... to making it my wallpaper.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          As an entry level Software Engineer I believe this mindset will serve me well. It will allow me to learn as much about as possible in as short of duration of time as possible. And I mean the only thing I want in return is to be allowed to keep learning.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Sounds like a pretty good deal to me...
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          Less time for onboarding, unlimited willingness to try the harder projects. Most importantly a deep desire to improve constantly. I do think it would be useful to mention that I have worked on personal projects that have gotten real users to join. Some of my favorite builds have been:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-200 ml-4 space-y-2">
          <li>A Cloud Formation to Terraform converter with 31 users</li>
          <li>A Stock Options Toolkit posted on ChatGPT Plugins with 100s of users</li>
          <li>A Healthcare Search Engine with 20 Private Practices using it</li>
          <li>An E-Commerce website template with 6 stores built on top of it</li>
          <li>A Thriller E-Book read by 300+ People</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-200">
          I like to build, I like to learn, and I for some reason love to work. I look forward to hearing from you.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-200 mt-8">
          Thank you,<br />

          P.S. I wrote this cover letter after learning Copy Writing from Gary Halbert & Sam Parr (two very famous
          copywriters). Just another example of me learning constantly. If you would like a more professional cover letter
          please let me know.
